# Facebook-Post-Aggression-Identification

# Task
Aggression Identification and Hate Speech detection had become an essential part of cyberharassment and cyberbullying and an automatic aggression identification can lead to the interception of such trolling. Following the same idealization, we participated in the workshop (Kumar et al., 2018a) which included a shared task on ’Aggression Identification’. The task was
aimed to develop a system that could make a 3-way classification between ’Overtly Aggressive (OAG)’, ’Covertly Aggressive (CAG)’ and ’Non-aggressive (NAG)’ over text data. For that, a dataset of 15,000 aggression-annotated Facebook Posts and Comments written in Hindi (in both Roman and Devanagari script) and English languages was developed (Kumar et al., 2018b) (this
dataset will be made publicly available after the end of the competition).

Especially, the English developed system, when used to classify Social Media text, outperforms all the shared task submitted systems.
